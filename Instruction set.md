| ------ | -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | ADD      | 2              | **Add** the value stored in the memory location represented by the operand to the value in the accumulator. Store the result mod 1000 in the accumulator. Set the carry flag to 1 if the result is greater than 999, else set the carry flag to 0. |
| 2      | SUB      | 2              | **Subtract** the value stored in the memory location represented by the operand from the value in the accumulator. Store the result mod 1000 in the accumulator. Set the carry flag to 1 if the result is negative, else set the carry flag to 0.  |
| 3      | STA      | 2              | **Store** the value in the accumulator into the memory location represented by the operand. Overwrites any value previously stored in that memory location.                                                                                        |
| 5      | LDA      | 2              | **Load** the value stored in the memory location represented by the operand into the accumulator. Overwrite any value previously stored in the accumulator.                                                                                        |
| 6      | BRA      | 2              | **Branch always**. Set the program counter to the value of the operand. The operand will be the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.                                                                                             |
| 7      | BRZ      | 2              | **Branch if zero**. If the value in the accumulator is 000, set the program counter to the value of the operand. If this is the case, the operand will be the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.                               |
| 8      | BRP      | 2              | **Branch if positive**. If the carry flag is 1, set the program counter to the value of the operand. If this is the case, the operand will be the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.                                           |
| 901    | INP      | 0              | **Input** a value (0-999) from the user and store it in the accumulator.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 902    | OUT      | 0              | **Output** the value from the accumulator to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 000    | HLT      | 0              | **Halt** execution of the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|        | DAT      | 3              | **Data**. Store the value (0-999) in the operand to a memory location. Useful with labels in order to declare variables.                                                                                                                           |
